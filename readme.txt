GUIDELINES

TASK
Create a todo application using TypeScript that implements CRUD (Create, Read, Update,
Delete) operations for managing tasks.
Requirements:
1. Classes only (no functions): Use classes to represent data models and services.
2. Interfaces/Types: Define interfaces or types to specify the expected structure of data.
3. Private Constructor: Enforce immutability of todo objects by making the constructor
private.
4. JSON Storage: Store todo data in a JSON file using json-server.
5. CRUD Operations: Implement methods in the TodoService class to:
o Create new todos
o Read existing todos
o Update existing todos (including marking completion)
o Delete todos
Additional Considerations:
• You can decide on the specific details of the user interface (UI) for interacting with the
app.
• Consider ways to handle errors during data loading/saving.
